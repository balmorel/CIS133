     <p id="text"><h3>Three design principles that have been well-implemented:</h3>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Navigation and header areas are consistent throughout the website creating a degree<br>
                of familiarity that is consistent with best practices.</li><br>
            <li>Use of color is attractive and consistent with varying degrees of blues and white that are reminiscent<br> 
                of the ocean and sky; it suits the business's niche.</li><br>
            <li>The creator of the website has adhered to elements of writing for the web. There is <br>
                consistent use of headers and subheaders and the paragraphs have been kept brief to <br>
                account for contemporary attention spans.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <h3>Three design practices that could be implemented in a better way:</h3>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Content has a number of spelling errors ("streucturees" on the "yurts" page) that detract from<br> 
                the integrity of the website and therefore the business.</li><br>
            <li>The designers could have done a better job with the various header images and their image quality.<br>
                It looks like they have lost the aspect ratio of the images - they appear to have been stretche wide.
            </li><br>
            <li>Use of white space and the relationship with the text is not well-balanced (particularly on <br>
                the homepage). There is a disproportionate amount of whitespace to the right of the page <br>
                which creates an awkward eye pull away from important content.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <h3>Other ways I would I improve this website:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong><em>Greater use of media and images:</em></strong></dt>
                <dd>This website should have, at the very least, images of what a Yurt dwelling entails. <br>
                    How about some video of guests enjoying the kayaking experience or bird watching? <br> 
                    Potential customers want to have some visual aided feel of the activities and accomodations.
                </dd><br>
            <dt><strong><em>Accentuating the Dining Experience:</em></strong></dt>
                <dd>When someone is pondering a vacation like this one, dining is traditionally one of the most <br>
                    important elements of the overall experience. The designers have not included any content<br>
                    featuring the bounty of food that awaits them should they choose Pacific Trails Resort.

            </dd><br>
            <dt><strong><em>Greater Personalization:</em></strong></dt>
            <dd>It would be nice to feel a personal touch with images of the staff interacting with guests, or <br>
                an 'about us' section that introduces the various staff and their repsonsibilities.
